### Tic Tac Toe Walkthrough

We spent the class walking through building a tic-tac-toe game demonstrating lots of JavaScript and React concepts.

The homework for this class is to make sure you complete the component so that it is fully functional. Also, once you are done, study the code to make sure you understand it and spend some time in the debugger to follow the sequence of steps.

After you have a good understanding, try removing the code and starting from scratch.

I've pushed my code to GitHub so you can take a look at that if you need to.
